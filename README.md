# Book-Recommender-System
## Introduction
The Book Recommender System is a web application developed using Flask, offering two main recommendation algorithms: Popularity-Based Recommender System and Collaborative Filtering Recommender System. The web app provides users with a list of the top 50 popular books from the dataset on the homepage and also offers personalized book recommendations based on user input.

## Features

1. **Homepage:** The web app's homepage displays a list of the top 50 popular books from the dataset.

2. **Collaborative Filtering Recommendations:** Users can input the name of a book, and the system will provide four book recommendations that are most similar to the book entered. This feature is powered by Collaborative Filtering, using cosine similarity to find similar items in the dataset.
